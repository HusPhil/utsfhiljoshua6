			<p>I am Fhil Joshua P. Caguicla, a naive kid who lives in the small, insignificant, but special 
				town of San Isidro. Often aloof inside my bedroom, I like to travel dimensions, explore other worlds, 
				and sail the high seas. Well, in the world where the novel I am currently immersed in is 
				taking place, anyway. <br> <br>

				I was introduced to a very simple way of living life. But as we all know, the sweet yet poisonous 
				fate of growing up always makes things a bit more interesting but complicated at the same time. 
				Once I was just a boy, but alas, I must now hesitantly live life anew and call myself a man. <br><br>
				
				Aside from being introverted, I am also a very discreet person. It's not that I'm afraid of opening 
				myself up to other people, it's just that I'm often unsure of how to express myself clearly; 
				I'm afraid of being judged negatively if I can't.  <br> <br>
				
				Unsurprisingly, I can only count the people whom I can call friends between my fingers. 
				Nevertheless, I strive to be an individual who is socially capable of befriending more people. 
				Because in this world where the pursuit of happiness leads to a life that is contrastingly desolate, 
				I believe I must have allies who will accompany me throughout my journey.</p>
